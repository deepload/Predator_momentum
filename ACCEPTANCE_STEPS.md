# Acceptance Steps for Predator Momentum

## Overview
This document outlines the acceptance criteria and steps for validating the Predator Momentum application on a Flipper Zero device with Momentum firmware. The focus is on ensuring stability and functionality, especially for Tesla security testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

### General Requirements
- The application must build and deploy successfully without errors.
- All menu navigation must function without white screens or crashes.
- Core functionalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, SubGHz, Car, RFID/NFC attacks) must be accessible and operational.
- The application must not cause Flipper Zero reboots during operation.

### Tesla-Specific Requirements
- Car Attacks scene must include:
  - Charge port security testing
  - Supercharger network security testing
  - Battery management system testing
  - Rolling code attacks
  - Passive key vulnerability testing
  - Signal jamming resistance testing
- Comprehensive car models database must be accessible.
- TPMS spoofing and GPS spoofing functionalities must be implemented.

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: Deployment Validation
1. Build the application using `ufbt build` from the project directory.
2. Deploy the `.fap` file to the Flipper Zero using `ufbt flash` or manual copy to `/apps/Tools/`.
3. Verify the application appears in the `Tools` menu on the device.

### Step 2: Navigation Audit
1. Launch the Predator Momentum application.
2. Navigate through all main menu items (WiFi Attacks, Bluetooth Attacks, SubGHz Attacks, Car Attacks, RFID Attacks, etc.).
3. Confirm no white screens or crashes occur during navigation.
4. Verify each submenu item leads to the correct scene or displays an appropriate placeholder popup.

### Step 3: Functionality Testing
1. Test WiFi Attacks:
   - Scan: Verify WiFi scanning starts and stops correctly.
   - Deauth: Confirm deauthentication attack simulation.
   - Evil Twin: Check Evil Twin attack setup and operation.
2. Test Bluetooth Attacks:
   - Scan: Verify Bluetooth scanning functionality.
   - Spam: Confirm Bluetooth spam attack simulation.
3. Test SubGHz Attacks:
   - Ensure placeholder popups appear for unimplemented features without crashes.
4. Test RFID Attacks:
   - Clone: Verify RFID cloning simulation.
   - Bruteforce: Confirm bruteforce attack simulation.
5. Test GPS Tracker and Wardriving:
   - Ensure GPS tracking and Wardriving scenes load without crashes.

### Step 4: Tesla-Specific Testing
1. Navigate to Car Attacks scene.
2. Test each submenu item:
   - Car Models: Verify access to the car models database.
   - Tesla Charge Port: Confirm charge port security test simulation.
   - Key Bruteforce: Check key bruteforce attack simulation.
   - Jamming: Verify signal jamming simulation.
   - Passive Opener: Confirm passive opener attack simulation.
3. Ensure no reboots occur during these tests.

### Step 5: Stability Testing
1. Run each attack simulation for at least 5 minutes to check for stability.
2. Switch between scenes frequently to test for memory leaks or crashes.
3. Verify the device remains operational without reboots.

### Step 6: Settings and Persistence
1. Access Settings scene.
2. Modify settings (if implemented) and confirm they are saved and loaded correctly after app restart.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Application builds and deploys successfully.
- [ ] Navigation audit completed with no white screens or crashes.
- [ ] Core functionalities tested and operational.
- [ ] Tesla-specific features implemented and tested.
- [ ] Stability confirmed with no reboots during testing.
- [ ] Settings persistence verified (if implemented).

## Post-Acceptance
- Document any issues or limitations found during testing.
- Prepare for hardware smoke tests and Tesla dry-run if all criteria are met.
- Update project documentation with test results and any hotfixes applied.

If any criteria are not met, please report the issues to the development team for immediate resolution before proceeding to on-site testing.
