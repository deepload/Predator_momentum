## Introduction

The Predator module is a comprehensive penetration testing expansion for the Flipper Zero device. It adds advanced capabilities including WiFi attacks, Bluetooth scanning, SubGHz operations, GPS tracking, and more. This guide covers all aspects of using the Predator module with your Flipper Zero.

## Hardware Setup

### Installing the Predator Module

1. Power off your Flipper Zero completely
2. Align the Predator module with the GPIO pins on your Flipper Zero
3. Gently press down until the module is fully seated
4. Attach the required antennas (see Antenna Setup section)
5. Power on your Flipper Zero

### Physical Components

- **ESP32-S2 Marauder** processor (Pins 15,16)
- **GPS Module** (Pins 13,14)
- **A07 433MHz RF Module** (10dBm)
- **2.8" Display** with 800mAh battery
- **Two control switches** (front left and right)
- **Multiple antenna ports**

## Switch Configuration

The Predator module has two important switches that control different hardware components:

### Left Switch (GPS Power Switch)
- **Position DOWN**: Powers the GPS module using the Flipper Zero's power
- **Position UP**: Uses the Predator module's internal battery for GPS power
- **Function**: Set to DOWN when you want to save the Predator's internal battery and use Flipper's power instead.

### Right Switch (Marauder Enable Switch)
- **Position DOWN**: Disables the ESP32 Marauder module
- **Position UP**: Enables the ESP32 Marauder module for WiFi/Bluetooth attacks
- **Function**: Set to UP when you want to use WiFi scanning, deauth attacks, or Bluetooth functions.

## Antenna Setup

The Predator module includes several antenna ports, each designed for specific operations:

![Antenna Layout](antenna_layout.jpg)

- **433M**: Connect the 433MHz antenna here for SubGHz operations (car keys, RF)
- **A**: Main WiFi antenna port (2.4GHz) - This is the primary antenna for WiFi operations
- **GPS**: Connect the GPS antenna here for location tracking functions
- **B/C**: Secondary 2.4GHz antenna ports for WiFi operations (enhances performance)
- **D**: Optional diversity antenna port
- **2.4G**: Additional 2.4GHz ports marked as 1 and 2 for specialized operations

For best results:
- Always use the correct antenna for each frequency range
- Hand-tighten antennas only - do not overtighten
- Keep antennas perpendicular when in use
- For GPS functions, ensure the GPS antenna has a clear view of the sky
